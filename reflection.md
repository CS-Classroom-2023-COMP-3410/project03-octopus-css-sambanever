My css development process was pretty simple. I decided to go the external CSS route rather than use inline styles in the html file as I thought it would be easier to not get overwhelmed and stay organized.

My main problem I faced was when I first looked at the file and thought about what to do, I felt pretty overwhelmed and didn't really know how to begin. So I also decided to go from top to bottom as cleanly as I could in my css styles. I began with the header section and added styles to the elements as I moved down the page. This worked pretty well for me because it helped me to organize my thoughts and think about immediate next steps, as well as debug any issues I ran into.
